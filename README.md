SumCity
=======

SumCity is a plausible virtual city with a population of plausible virtual people.

NOTE: It's mostly just an experiment! Also, it's not nearly done yet!

My primary goal is to create a procedurally generated setting and populace that could be used as a setting for a game or virtual world. In contrast to a typical game or virtual world where the same characters are always found in the same locations (and other locations could never be accessible because mapping the boring places out is too difficult for designers), SumCity residents behave as if they actually live in the city, spending most time at home or at work, but also going out at night, shopping, going on vacation, etc.

Secondarily, I have some basic constructs in mind that I hope can induce interesting social patterns not directly programmed in. I'm hoping to see romance or crime waves or protest marches or rags-to-riches (or the inverse) stories. These are what separate sim city from the Truman Show.
